# WaniKaniKeebi

WaniKaniKeebi automatically opens the Item Info panel during WaniKani review
sessions after you've submitted an answer.

This is a simple Firefox extension to solve my own annoyance with WaniKani
reviews. When I submit an answer, I want to see the information about it or at
least have it to hand without needing to go clicking or tabbing around.

Maybe if I find another need I'll add some more functionality, but for now,
extensions like Vimium work just fine.
